## About at-school
It's an E-learning platform that was built to allow continuance in the flow of education during the pandemic.

## About This Repo
Funny Enough. I started at-school to tone my Laravel and React Skills. I was still learning Laravel when I started it.
Well, I now have a very large ugly, disorganized uncollaborative workspace of __fat Controller__ code yet running that functional site.

I've gone really far with Laravel, and Inertia. So I will be recreating that site plus additional features in:

 **Laravel - Inertia - React**. 

 I'm still deliberating if this should be a Private or Public RepoðŸ˜ƒ

It's public for now, As you can see. That might change depending on ... .

## How do I set this up
